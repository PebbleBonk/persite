Oh boy, here we go again

Some longer text right here. should use lorem ipsum or some other generator. a plugin for visual studio code prolly exists but man, it its basically the same time just to type in some bs like this to tpopoulate the file

## Some real stuff

About the project and struggle and inspiration to help others should maybe go here. yeah. to make me look real good in the eyes of unforgiving internet people.

Rather inpropable though, don't you think. More probably is the following to happen:

1. Make a portfolio website
2. Launch it
3. ???
4. Profit

### Truth behind it

    - Can they be nested
    - I wonder
