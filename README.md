## PerSite - Tell me a bit about yourself

---
This project was inspired by the always expanding amount of personal projects, mostly residing silently on my hard drive, without any knowledge spread to the public. I wanted the peer pressure to finish some of them, as well as a site to market my skills and experiences. 

As I was not satisfied with any available portfolio/personal website templates, I simply decided to do what most stubborn engineers love - make a better version myself.
